        <p>The Kellogg School of Management (The Kellogg School or Kellogg) is the business school of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, with additional campuses in downtown Chicago, Illinois and Miami, Florida. Kellogg offers full-time, part-time, and executive programs, and partners with schools in China, France/Singapore, India, Spain, Hong Kong, Israel, Germany, Canada, and Thailand.

        <p>Founded in 1908 in downtown Chicago as a part-time evening program, the school was chartered to educate business leaders with "good moral character". Kellogg pioneered the use of group projects and evaluations and popularized the importance of "teamwork" and "team leadership" within the business world.</p>
